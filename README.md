### BENNT3 

- My name is Timothy Bennett. (Call me Tim.)
- Unicycling is my favourite hobby, I can ride a unicycle pretty efficiently.
- I thoroughly enjoy the hardware side of IT, as well as programming in general, learning new languages is fun!
- This course was essentially forced on me but I'm pretty happy with it, very valuable skills and also very different from PP1.
